### This project contains examples of CRUD using React + Rails for three models: Users, Favorites, and Movies.

## Technologies Used

 * Heroku
 * PostgresQL
 * Ruby
 * Rails
 * React
 * HTML5
 * CSS3
 * Styled Components
 * JavaScript
 * Trello
 * Imgur
 * VS Code Editor

## App Objective:
This app, titled 'Watch-Next' is designed to allow a user to search for movies from the OMDBapi and save them to a favorites list. Once a movie is on the user's favorite's list, people can view the user's list to see if there is a movie they'd like to "watch next". For future development, I'd like to add the ability to comment on a user's favorites list, and see a list of recommended movies. The recommended movies will be based off of movies a user has added to their favorites.

## Features:

* CRUD functionality for users, favorites, and movies. (Limited CRUD on movies)
* The ability to search an external API and return movie data.
* Responsive site using media query - (WIP)
* Cloud based database deployed to Heroku
